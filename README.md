# Programming for Everybody(Getting-started-with-Python)
This course describes the basics of the Python programming language and learning to install Python and write our first program.Using variables to store, retrieve and calculate information.Utilizing core programming tools such as functions and loops.

## Topics covered in course
1.Ungraded External Tool: Ungraded External ToolPython Code Playground.

2.Lecture Interview: Daphne Koller - Building Coursera LectureFace-to-Face Milan, Italy

3.Variables and Expressions:In this I learnt how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information.

4.The Conditional Code: In this section I moved from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped. It is a very simple concept,but it is how computer software makes "choices".

5.Functions: I understood what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions becomes an essential part to make sense of the code.

6.Loops and Iteration: Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved.
